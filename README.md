TimerFactory
============

Timer factory is used to create an instance of a generic timer with getters, setters and utility functions of a tradational timer with .start(), .stop(), .reset() functions. This factory pattern in JavaScript follows the classic factory pattern in Object Oriented Programming. See demo.index in a browser for a quick demo. Use browser console to see ticks. Future version will update demo.index to present more statistics of the timer, such as showing the ticks and elapsed time on HTML page.
